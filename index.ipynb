    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the last lab that we had a training accuracy close to 90% and a test set accuracy close to 76%.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with our previous machine learning work, we should be asking a couple of questions:\n",
    "- Is there a high bias? yes/no\n",
    "- Is there a high variance? yes/no\n",
    "\n",
    "Also recall that \"high bias\" is a relative concept. Knowing we have 7 classes and the topics are related, we'll assume that a 90% accuracy is pretty good and the bias on the training set is low. (We've also discussed concepts like precision, recall as well as AUC and ROC curves.)   \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll use the notion of training/validation/test set to get better insights of how we can mitigate our variance, and we'll look at a few regularization techniques. You'll start by repeating the process from the last section: importing the data and performing preprocessing including one-hot encoding. Then, just before you go on to train the model, we'll introduce how to include a validation set. You'll then define and compile the model as before. This time, when you are presented with the `history` dictionary of the model, you will have additional data entries for not only the train and test, but the train, test and validation  and then defigning, compiling and training the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Construct and run a basic model in Keras\n",
    "* Construct a validation set and explain potential benefits\n",
    "* Apply L1 and L2 regularization\n",
    "* Aplly dropout regularization\n",
    "* Observe and comment on the effect of using more data"

The first thing we'll be doing is importing the data and taking a random sample, so that should clue you in to what tools to import.
